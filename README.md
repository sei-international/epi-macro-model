# COVID baseline model
This is the Python source code for SEI's "epi-macro model", an epidemiological-macroeconomic model for medium-run analysis in developing countries. The software allows planners to explore likely scenarios in ways that take into account the ways in which the pandemic and related policy measures may affect the national economy and the global economic environment

**Key features include:**
  - explore effect of public health measures including social distancing, masking, isolation of vulnerable populations and vaccination on epidemic developments and the national economy
  - examine potential ramifications for sector-specific outputs, value added, and gross domestic product (GDP)
  - ability to simulate multiple strains of a contagious disease like COVID-19
  - ability to simulate risk of reinfection and waning immunity 

The script can be run using any Python 3.x. There is also a 64-bit Windows executable available.


## Getting started with the epi-macro model
