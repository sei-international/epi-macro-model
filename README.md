# Epidemiological-macroeconomic Model
This is the Python source code for the SEI Epidemiological-macroeconomic Model, a software designed to help national and regional authorities generate scenarios that incorporate both the economic ramifications of the pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread. The software allows planners to explore likely future scenarios that take into account how the pandemic and related policy measures may affect the national economy and the global economic environment.

**Key features include:**
  * Modeling effect of public health measures on epidemic developments and the national economy, such as
     * International travel restrictions
     * Social distancing
     * Isolating symptomatic and vulnerable individuals
     * Testing and tracing 
     * Vaccination regimes
  * Modeling of potential ramifications for sector-specific outputs, value added, and gross domestic product (GDP)
  * Modeling spread of multiple strains of a contagious disease like COVID-19 in a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model
  * Modeling of reinfections and waning immunity 
  * Resolution of regional variations such as rural and urban settings, or destinations that attract, or are seldom affected by, international travel.

The script can be run using any Python 3.x. There is also a 64-bit Windows executable available.
